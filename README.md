# Zluri Employee App Catalog

This project is a frontend prototype of an employee app catalog, designed to showcase a modern, user-friendly interface for managing and discovering software within a company.

## Features

- **My Workspace**: A personalized dashboard for employees to see their current apps, requests, and recommendations.
- **Proactive License Optimization**: A smart assistant on the "My Workspace" dashboard that identifies underutilized software licenses and suggests de-provisioning them.
- **App Catalog**: A central repository of all available applications, with advanced filtering options.
- **Advanced Filtering for Discovery**: Filters on the App Catalog page, allowing employees to narrow down apps by category (e.g., "Design"), cost model ("Free", "Team License"), or compliance tags ("GDPR Compliant").
- **App Profiles**: Detailed pages for each application, including descriptions, features, and an interactive Q&A section.
- **Interactive Q&A on App Profiles**: A section on each app's profile where employees can ask questions and get answers from designated internal "Power Users" or the IT team.
- **Suggest an App**: A transparent workflow for employees to suggest new applications and track the approval process.
